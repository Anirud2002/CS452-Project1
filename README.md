## Experience

This project was not too bad given that I had good understanding of what single linked list was and how it should work. I did have spend time google and asking AI on how pointer work like deferencing and free-ing up the memory of pointers. I also had to lookup about "sentinel" node which was something I hadn't heard off. This is cool approach. Over all, it was a good project. I didn't have any leaks or issues.
